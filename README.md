## Playable Piano
A playable piano in JavaScript is an interactive web-based piano that users can play by either clicking on the keys with their mouse or pressing specific keys on their keyboard. The piano is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the JavaScript handles the logic for producing sound when a key is pressed.
